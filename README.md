This project implements a deep learning–based classification system to predict Parkinson’s disease using MRI report data. The workflow includes MRI data preprocessing, data augmentation, and train–test splitting to prepare the dataset for model training.

CNN-based architectures such as ResNet and EfficientNet are trained, fine-tuned, and evaluated to analyze their effectiveness in detecting Parkinson’s disease. Model performance is assessed using standard classification metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Tech Stack: Python, Deep Learning, CNN, ResNet, EfficientNet
